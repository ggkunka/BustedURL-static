# Agent Roles in BustedURL

## Overview

BustedURL employs a collaborative multi-agent system to detect and mitigate malicious URLs. Each agent has a specific role and responsibility, contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

## Agent Roles

### 1. Data Collection Agent

- **Function**: Collects URLs from multiple sources such as web traffic, social media, email traffic, and dark web forums.
- **Techniques**: Uses web scraping, API integration, and stream processing frameworks like Apache Kafka.
- **Objective**: To ensure a diverse and up-to-date dataset for analysis.

### 2. Feature Extraction Agent

- **Function**: Extracts features from URLs using advanced machine learning models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, DistilBERT).
- **Techniques**: Ensemble feature extraction, specializing in different aspects like syntax, semantics, and context.
- **Objective**: To provide a comprehensive representation of URLs for accurate classification.

### 3. Classification Agent

- **Function**: Classifies URLs as malicious or benign using a stacking model approach with multiple base models and a meta-model.
- **Techniques**: Uses models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
- **Objective**: To enhance detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

### 4. Response Agent

- **Function**: Executes predefined actions based on the classification results (e.g., blocking URLs, sending alerts).
- **Techniques**: Utilizes automated incident response tools and reinforcement learning to optimize response strategies.
- **Objective**: To minimize the impact of detected threats and improve adaptability.

### 5. System Optimizer Agent

- **Function**: Monitors overall system performance and dynamically adjusts resource allocation and parameters.
- **Techniques**: Uses horizontal scaling, continuous learning pipelines, and optimization algorithms.
- **Objective**: To maintain optimal system performance and scalability.

### 6. Security Auditor Agent

- **Function**: Conducts regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security standards.
- **Techniques**: Uses automated vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and compliance checks.
- **Objective**: To maintain a strong security posture and protect against potential attacks.

### 7. Health Monitoring Agent

- **Function**: Monitors system health, detects anomalies, and triggers appropriate actions to maintain operational stability.
- **Techniques**: Uses real-time monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and anomaly detection algorithms.
- **Objective**: To ensure the continuous, reliable operation of the system.

## Conclusion

Each agent in BustedURL plays a crucial role in ensuring the overall system's efficiency, accuracy, and security. Their combined efforts create a robust multi-agent system capable of adapting to new threats and maintaining high performance.
