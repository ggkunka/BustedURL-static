# BustedURL Architecture

## Overview

BustedURL is a Collaborative Multi-Agent System (CMAS) designed to detect and mitigate malicious URLs in real-time. The architecture is based on a decentralized coordination hub that facilitates communication and coordination among various agents. Each agent operates autonomously, yet collaborates to achieve the common goal of enhancing URL detection accuracy and system robustness.

## System Components

### 1. Decentralized Coordination Hub

The coordination hub acts as the central communication channel for all agents, enabling them to share data, alerts, and updates. It is designed to handle messaging and ensure that each agent performs its role efficiently without central control. The hub is decentralized, meaning that it does not act as a single point of failure and can scale horizontally.

### 2. Agents

- **Data Collection Agent**: Responsible for gathering URLs from various sources (e.g., social media, emails, web traffic, dark web forums). This agent utilizes web scraping, API integration, and stream processing techniques.
  
- **Feature Extraction Agent**: Utilizes multiple transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to extract features from URLs for effective classification.
  
- **Classification Agent**: Applies a stacking model approach with base models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks) and a Gradient Boosting Machine meta-model to classify URLs as malicious or benign.

- **Response Agent**: Automates the response to detected threats, including blocking URLs, sending alerts, or executing predefined actions.

- **System Optimizer Agent**: Monitors and adjusts system performance dynamically by reallocating resources and fine-tuning parameters.

- **Security Auditor Agent**: Conducts regular audits to identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensures compliance with security protocols.

- **Health Monitoring Agent**: Continuously monitors the health of the system, detects anomalies, and triggers appropriate actions to maintain stability.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: URLs are collected from various sources by the Data Collection Agent.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The collected data is processed by the Feature Extraction Agent to derive meaningful representations.
3. **Classification**: The processed data is fed into the Classification Agent to determine whether the URLs are malicious or benign.
4. **Response**: The Response Agent takes action based on the classification results.
5. **Monitoring and Optimization**: The System Optimizer Agent, Security Auditor Agent, and Health Monitoring Agent work in parallel to ensure the system's performance, security, and stability.

## Communication

Agents communicate through the decentralized coordination hub, utilizing asynchronous messaging protocols to exchange information in real-time.

## Scalability and Resilience

The decentralized architecture enables horizontal scaling by adding more agents or nodes to handle increased data volume and ensure robustness against single points of failure.

## Conclusion

The architecture of BustedURL provides a flexible, scalable, and robust solution for real-time detection and mitigation of malicious URLs. The use of a decentralized coordination hub enhances the system's ability to adapt to evolving threats and maintain high performance.
