## Introduction

With the rise of phishing attacks and malicious URLs, BustedURL offers an innovative solution by employing a decentralized multi-agent system. Each agent within the system has a specialized role, ranging from data collection to real-time response, and works collaboratively to enhance overall system performance and detection rates.

## Architecture

BustedURL is built on a decentralized coordination hub that facilitates communication and collaboration among the agents. The system consists of several agents, each responsible for specific tasks:

- **Data Collection Agent**: Collects URLs from multiple sources, including social media, emails, and dark web forums.
- **Feature Extraction Agent**: Extracts features from URLs using advanced machine learning models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).
- **Classification Agent**: Classifies URLs as malicious or benign using a stacking approach with multiple base models.
- **Response Agent**: Executes predefined actions based on classification results (e.g., blocking URLs).
- **System Optimizer Agent**: Monitors and optimizes overall system performance.
- **Security Auditor Agent**: Conducts regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance.
- **Health Monitoring Agent**: Monitors system health and detects anomalies to maintain operational stability.

## Agents Overview

- **Data Collection Agent**: Responsible for acquiring and pre-processing URLs from various sources in real-time.
- **Feature Extraction Agent**: Uses ensemble learning techniques to extract features for accurate URL classification.
- **Classification Agent**: Implements machine learning models to classify URLs as malicious or benign.
- **Response Agent**: Automatically takes actions to mitigate threats, such as blocking URLs or sending alerts.
- **System Optimizer Agent**: Continuously evaluates system performance and adjusts resources dynamically.
- **Security Auditor Agent**: Ensures the system's security posture by identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.
- **Health Monitoring Agent**: Ensures the health and stability of the entire system by monitoring and responding to anomalies.

## Core Components

- **Decentralized Coordination Hub**: The central communication and decision-making entity that enables effective collaboration among agents.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art models (e.g., BERT, Gradient Boosting Machines) for feature extraction and classification.
- **Stream Processing Framework**: Real-time data processing using frameworks like Apache Kafka.

## Installation
