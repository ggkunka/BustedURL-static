# BustedURL: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Detecting Malicious URLs

**BustedURL** is a Collaborative Multi-Agent System (CMAS) designed to enhance the detection of malicious URLs by leveraging multiple autonomous agents that work together to share control, communicate, learn, and adapt dynamically. Each agent in the system is responsible for a specific function, and their collaboration results in a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution compared to traditional single-agent systems.

## Advantages of BustedURL CMAS Design

- **Increased Efficiency**: Agents divide tasks for optimized performance.
- **Scalability**: New agents can be added as needed to handle larger workloads.
- **Robustness**: Distributed nature prevents system-wide failure due to single-agent issues.
- **Flexibility**: Independent agents allow the system to adapt dynamically to new threats.
- **Enhanced Problem-Solving**: Multiple strategies are used across agents for better results.

## Disadvantages Considered

- **Coordination Complexity**: Managed using a central coordination hub.
- **Increased Overhead**: Mitigated through hierarchical agent structure and efficient communication protocols.
- **Data Security**: Addressed using secure communication channels and regular audits by the Security Auditor Agent.
- **Inter-Agent Conflicts**: Resolved through conflict resolution algorithms and synchronization points.

## Explanation of the Enhanced Architecture:
- **Central Coordination Hub (CH):** Acts as the main orchestrator, distributing tasks, managing resources, and ensuring synchronization among agents.
Interfaces with each agent to maintain a cohesive system function.

- **Data Collection Agent (DC):** Collects URLs from various sources and prioritizes them for processing.
Sends the collected data to the Feature Extraction Agent (FE) for further analysis.

- **Feature Extraction Agent (FE):** Extracts and refines features from URLs, enhancing their semantic and syntactic properties.
Shares the extracted features with the Classification Agent (CA) for classification tasks.

- **Classification Agent (CA):** Classifies URLs based on the provided features.
Collaborates with other agents (e.g., the Response Agent (RA)) to fine-tune classification models and thresholds.

- **Response Agent (RA):** Executes appropriate responses (e.g., blocking URLs, alerting users).
Provides feedback to the System Optimizer Agent (SO) to improve overall system performance.

- **System Optimizer Agent (SO):** Monitors system performance and adjusts resources dynamically.
Recommends adjustments to other agents to ensure optimal performance and scalability.

- **Security Auditor Agent (SA):** Conducts regular security checks and ensures compliance with security policies.
Provides security insights to the Health Monitoring Agent (HM) and Central Coordination Hub (CH).

- **Health Monitoring Agent (HM):** Monitors the health of all agents, triggers failovers if needed, and reports the system status.
Communicates health insights back to the Central Coordination Hub (CH).

## Key Features of This CMAS Design:
- **Inter-Agent Communication:** Each agent communicates with others, sharing critical information like feature data, security insights, and performance metrics.
- **Collaboration and Autonomy:** Agents work autonomously while coordinating with others to improve overall functionality, making the system highly adaptive and robust.
- **Feedback and Learning:** The Response Agent provides feedback that influences other agentsâ€™ operations, such as dynamic adjustments to resource allocation and threat response.
- **Performance Optimization:** The System Optimizer Agent continuously monitors and recommends changes to enhance performance, scalability, and adaptability.
