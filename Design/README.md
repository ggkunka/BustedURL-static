# BustedURL: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Detecting Malicious URLs

**BustedURL** is a Collaborative Multi-Agent System (CMAS) designed to enhance the detection of malicious URLs by leveraging multiple autonomous agents that work together to share control, communicate, learn, and adapt dynamically. Each agent in the system is responsible for a specific function, and their collaboration results in a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution compared to traditional single-agent systems.

## Advantages of BustedURL CMAS Design

- **Increased Efficiency**: Agents divide tasks for optimized performance.
- **Scalability**: New agents can be added as needed to handle larger workloads.
- **Robustness**: Distributed nature prevents system-wide failure due to single-agent issues.
- **Flexibility**: Independent agents allow the system to adapt dynamically to new threats.
- **Enhanced Problem-Solving**: Multiple strategies are used across agents for better results.

## Disadvantages Considered

- **Coordination Complexity**: Managed using a central coordination hub.
- **Increased Overhead**: Mitigated through hierarchical agent structure and efficient communication protocols.
- **Data Security**: Addressed using secure communication channels and regular audits by the Security Auditor Agent.
- **Inter-Agent Conflicts**: Resolved through conflict resolution algorithms and synchronization points.

## Explanation of the Enhanced Architecture:
## Agents Overview
## Data Collection Agent
Role: Gathers URLs from various sources (e.g., web traffic, emails, social media, dark web forums) in real-time.

Functions:

collectURLs(): Collects URLs using web scraping and API integration.
prioritizeData(): Filters and prioritizes URLs based on potential threat levels.
ensureDataCompliance(): Ensures all collected data complies with privacy and security regulations.
## Feature Extraction Agent
Role: Processes the collected URLs to extract relevant features, enabling more accurate classification.

Functions:

extractFeatures(): Analyzes URLs for syntactic and semantic patterns using a combination of transformers like BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT.
enhanceFeatureSets(): Improves the feature set by incorporating new threat patterns.
sendFeaturesToClassifier(): Transmits extracted features to the Classification Agent for further analysis.
## Classification Agent
Role: Classifies the URLs as malicious or benign based on extracted features.

Functions:

classifyURLs(): Utilizes stacking and ensemble techniques (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks) with adaptive thresholding for better classification.
adjustModels(): Dynamically updates the classification model based on feedback.
collaborateOnClassification(): Works with other agents to improve detection accuracy.
## Response Agent
Role: Takes action based on the classification results to mitigate threats.

Functions:

executeResponse(): Blocks malicious URLs, sends alerts, and logs incidents.
handleFeedback(): Learns from previous responses to enhance future decisions.
notifyUsers(): Provides real-time notifications and education to users about detected threats.
## System Optimizer Agent
Role: Monitors and optimizes the overall system performance.

Functions:

optimizeSystem(): Analyzes the system's performance and recommends optimizations.
predictResourceNeeds(): Anticipates future resource requirements.
adjustResources(): Dynamically allocates resources for efficient operations.
## Security Auditor Agent
Role: Conducts regular security checks to ensure system integrity and compliance.

Functions:

conductSecurityChecks(): Performs periodic security assessments.
updatePolicies(): Adjusts security policies based on new threats.
ensureCompliance(): Verifies adherence to security standards and regulations.
## Health Monitoring Agent
Role: Continuously monitors the health of the system and its agents.

Functions:

monitorAgentHealth(): Tracks the status and performance of each agent.
triggerFailover(): Initiates failover protocols if an agent fails.
reportStatus(): Provides health reports to the Coordination Hub.

## Key Features of This CMAS Design:
- **Inter-Agent Communication:** Each agent communicates with others, sharing critical information like feature data, security insights, and performance metrics.
- **Collaboration and Autonomy:** Agents work autonomously while coordinating with others to improve overall functionality, making the system highly adaptive and robust.
- **Feedback and Learning:** The Response Agent provides feedback that influences other agentsâ€™ operations, such as dynamic adjustments to resource allocation and threat response.
- **Performance Optimization:** The System Optimizer Agent continuously monitors and recommends changes to enhance performance, scalability, and adaptability.
