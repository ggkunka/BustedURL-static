# BustedURL: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Detecting Malicious URLs

**BustedURL** is a Collaborative Multi-Agent System (CMAS) designed to enhance the detection of malicious URLs by leveraging multiple autonomous agents that work together to share control, communicate, learn, and adapt dynamically. Each agent in the system is responsible for a specific function, and their collaboration results in a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution compared to traditional single-agent systems.

## Advantages of BustedURL CMAS Design

- **Increased Efficiency**: Agents divide tasks for optimized performance.
- **Scalability**: New agents can be added as needed to handle larger workloads.
- **Robustness**: Distributed nature prevents system-wide failure due to single-agent issues.
- **Flexibility**: Independent agents allow the system to adapt dynamically to new threats.
- **Enhanced Problem-Solving**: Multiple strategies are used across agents for better results.

## Disadvantages Considered

- **Coordination Complexity**: Managed using a central coordination hub.
- **Increased Overhead**: Mitigated through hierarchical agent structure and efficient communication protocols.
- **Data Security**: Addressed using secure communication channels and regular audits by the Security Auditor Agent.
- **Inter-Agent Conflicts**: Resolved through conflict resolution algorithms and synchronization points.
