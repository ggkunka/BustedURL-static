# BustedURL Diagrams

This repository contains various diagrams for the **BustedURL** multi-agent AI system, illustrating its architecture, agent interactions, and collaboration mechanisms. These diagrams are intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the system is designed, how its components interact, and the overall flow of operations.

## Diagrams Overview

### 1. **System Architecture Diagram**

- **Description**: The System Architecture Diagram provides an overview of the entire **BustedURL** framework. It illustrates the various agents involved in the system, such as the Data Intelligence Agent, Feature Enhancement Agent, Adaptive Classifier Agent, Threat Response Agent, and System Optimizer Agent. This diagram shows the external and internal interfaces used for data input and output, as well as the communication paths between different agents and the Message Broker.
- **Purpose**: To offer a high-level understanding of the overall structure and components of the **BustedURL** system.
- **File**: `BustedURLArchitecture.drawio`

### 2. **Class Diagram**

- **Description**: The Class Diagram details the object-oriented structure of the **BustedURL** system. It displays the various classes (agents, message brokers, and knowledge bases), their attributes, and methods, as well as the relationships and dependencies among them.
- **Purpose**: To provide a clear understanding of the class structure and the interactions between different objects in the system.
- **File**: `BustedURLclass_diagram.drawio`

### 3. **State Diagram for Adaptive Classifier Agent**

- **Description**: This diagram shows the different states the **Adaptive Classifier Agent** can be in, such as Idle, Processing, Learning, Error Handling, and Completed. It also illustrates the transitions between these states based on specific events or conditions.
- **Purpose**: To visualize the state management and transitions of the **Adaptive Classifier Agent** within the **BustedURL** system.

### 4. **Flow Diagram for BustedURL Process**

- **Description**: The Flow Diagram represents the sequence of data flow and actions among different agents in the **BustedURL** system, from data collection to threat response and optimization. It outlines the collaboration and communication among agents, including feedback loops and performance monitoring.
- **Purpose**: To depict the operational flow and interaction between agents to achieve collaborative detection and response to malicious URLs.
